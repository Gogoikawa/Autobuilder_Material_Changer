# Zelda Tears of the Kingdom Autobuilder Item Changer

## Description:
The Zelda Tears of the Kingdom Autobuilder Item Changer is a executable designed to provide players with an effortless way to modify the item used for the autobuilder in the game. Rather than manually editing game files, this script offers a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) that allows you to select your preferred item for the autobuilder.

## Usage:
1. Run the script: `Autobuilder_Material_Changer.exe`
2. The GUI will open, presenting a list of available items. Simply choose the item you wish to set for the autobuilder.
3. Save the changes, and the new item will be automatically utilized by the autobuilder in the game.

## Mod Installation:

### Hacked Nintendo Switch:
Copy "romfs" to the "/atmosphere/contents/0100F2C0115B6000/" folder.

### Yuzu and Ryujinx (Nintendo Switch Emulators):
1. Locate the game's directory in Yuzu or Ryujinx, typically found in the emulator's folder under "user" or "load" directory.
2. Look for a folder named "0100F2C0115B6000." If it doesn't exist, you may need to run the game once in the emulator to generate the necessary files and folders.
3. Place the mod files inside the Title ID folder.
4. Launch Yuzu or Ryujinx, load the game, and the mods should now be applied.
